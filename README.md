## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm start

```

# How to play

Fill in the name of the characters with whom you want to play, and after this will appear the button to start the game, Player 1 is random, he starts, so it will be the X of the match and Player 2 will be 0 after the end of the match, given the victory of Player 1, Player 2 or in Draw, the button appears to restart the game

# Find a Character

If a character does not appear, a message will be displayed saying that this character was not found, if you do not know which character to find, in this [link](https://www.marvel.com/characters) are some of the characters you can play

### If you don't find a character:

### If the spider man is not dust :swith_smile:

# Some validations

In case no name is entered, the user will also be warned that it is necessary to include a name to be requested and loaded the image and the name of your character

### And the start button of the match will only appear if both characters are chosen
